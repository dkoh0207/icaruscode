# File:    pmtsimulation_icarus.fcl
# Purpose: Presets for configuration of ICARUS PMT channel digitization.
# 
# Configurations offered:
# 
# * `PMTsimulationAlg` algorithm:
#     * `icarus_pmtsimulationalg_standard`: main configuration, expected to be
#       used in production and by the general user
#     * `icarus_pmtsimulationalg_noise`: a general use configuration,
#       including dark and electronics noise disabled
#     * `icarus_pmtsimulationalg_nonoise`: as `icarus_pmtsimulationalg_noise`
#       but with dark and electronics noise disabled
# 
# Usage:
# 
# * `PMTsimulationAlg` algorithm configuration needs to be included verbatim
#     into the configuration of `SimPMTIcarus` module
#    
#
# Changes:
# 20181024 (petrillo@slac.stanford.edu)
#   detached from `opdetsim_pmt_icarus.fcl`
# 20200212 (petrillo@slac.stanford.edu)
#   reconnected quantum efficiency to the value in `opticalproperties_icarus.fcl`
# 20210206 (petrillo@slac.stanford.edu)
#   added explicit noise configuration, and made standard an alias of it
#

#
# Single photoelectron response with exponential rise and a fall shapes.
# 
# Parameters are reworked from an ICARUS trigger note (not yet released as
# of April 2020), which come from data analysis from the BNL group.
# 
# In particular, raise and fall times are reported to be 1.4 and 3.2 ns for
# the PMT, and 1.8 and 4.2 ns including the 37 m cable distortion.
# The average gain is considered to be 7 x 10^6 (somehow lower than the nominal
# 10^7 used below).
# Attenuation from the cable is considered negligible.
# 
# The peak charge is computed starting from the charge of a photoelectron
# (-1.6 x 10^-4 pC), multiplied by the gain (7 x 10^6). At signal peak time,
# the current from that charge is -0.14 mA, i.e. a voltage drop on 50 ohm
# of -7.06 mV.
# The digitizer converts a range up to 2 volt with 14 bit, which translates into
# about 8.192 ADC/mV and 409.6 ADC/mA.
# In short, the peak signal is expected to be -7.06 mV, -0.14 mA, -57.86 ADC.
