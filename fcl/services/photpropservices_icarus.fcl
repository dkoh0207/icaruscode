# File:    photpropservices_icarus.fcl
# Purpose: Configuration of services related to the optical detectors.
#
# Currently provides:
# * `icarus_photonvisibilityservice`: default configuration of
#     `PhotonVisibilityService` used in higher level standard scripts
#     (defined at the bottom of this configuration file)
# * `icarus_photonvisibilityservice_direct`: configuration of
#     `PhotonVisibilityService` using a photon visibility library and no mapping
# * `icarus_photonvisibilityservice_mapped`: configuration of
#     `PhotonVisibilityService` using a single cryostat photon visibility
#     library and a mapping
# * `icarus_photonvisibilityservice_mapped_oldPMTmap`: configuration of
#     `PhotonVisibilityService` using a single cryostat photon visibility
#     library and a library mapping, for use with the old PMT channel mapping
# * `icarus_photonvisibilityservice_2018`: configuration of
#     `PhotonVisibilityService` using the photon library tagged 20180801
#     library and a library mapping, for use with the old PMT channel mapping

### Legacy configurations
###
#
# This configuration should be used with the "old" PMT channel mapping.
# PMT channel mapping reflects the optical detector sorting.
# This sorting was changed when moving to the split wire geometry, so that the
# new geometry included a new TPC and PMT channel mapping.
# For the single wire geometry, this does not apply and the old configuration
# is needed.
# Use as:
#     
#     services.PhotonVisibilityService: @local::icarus_photonvisibilityservice_noPMTremapping
#     
# This configuration is almost self-contained (i.e. it would be self-contained
# except that it relies on
# `standard_library_vuv_prop_timing_photonvisibilityservice` which we are not
# reproducing here).

# This is the configuration used by the "standard" ICARUS job configurations

# It is part of `icarus_legacy_services` configuration, and it should not
# be used by itself since it requires a specific geometry and channel mapping.
# Use as:
#     
#     services: @local::icarus_legacy_services

#
# This configuration fits a previous photon library (August 2018) which
# was current until `icaruscode` `v09_00_01`.
# 
# The library was generated with the "old" PMT channel mapping, but now you
# are going to run it with the new one, so a remapping is needed,
# which is coded in this configuration.
# For the single wire geometry, this does not apply and the legac...ier
# configuration is needed.
