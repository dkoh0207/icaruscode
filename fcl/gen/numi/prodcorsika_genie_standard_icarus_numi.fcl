# Purpose: Generation of interactions of neutrinos from NuMI and cosmic rays.
# Author:  Gianluca Petrillo (petrillo@slac.standard.edu)
# Date:    February 2, 2021
#
# This job configuration generates events with the standard configuration of:
#  * NuMI neutrino interactions in full detector (actually, `volDetEnclosure`)
#  * cosmic rays with Constant Mass Composition model
# 
# Output
# -------
# 
# The main output is an _art_ ROOT file with content:
#  * `cosmicrays`: generated cosmic rays (`simb::MCTruth`)
#  * `generator`: generated neutrino interactions (`simb::MCTruth`),
#      beam information (`sim::BeamGateInfo`, `sumdata::POTSummary`),
#      flux (`simb::MCFlux`) and GENIE-specific information (`simb::GTruth`)
#      and relevant _art_ associations
# 
# 
# Service dependencies
# ---------------------
# 
# Services are inherited from the NuMI generation job.
# No further services appear to be needed.
