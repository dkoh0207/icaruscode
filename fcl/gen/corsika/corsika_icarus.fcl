# Also make sure that the cosmic sample time starts one full drift window 
# plus the g4 rise time (~1.2ms) before the TPC readout starts (-0.34ms);
# also needs to cover the PMT readout window (-1 ms to +1 ms)

# Thus, run from -1.5ms -> 1.3ms

#README: the directory written here are the place where you can find the files... you can download them and then change the "ShowerInputFiles" parameter to take into account of the path where you locally put the files

#BufferBox: extension to the volume of each cryostat for the purpose of filtering out the particles which do not cross the detector; each cryostat volume is independently extended by the same amount, specified here as shifts to lower x, higher x, lower y, higher y, lower z and higher z, in that order cm
#ProjectToHeight: the generated particles will appear to come from this height [cm]
#The time of the showers is uniformly distributed within the configured time interval, defined by SampleTime starting from TimeOffset.
